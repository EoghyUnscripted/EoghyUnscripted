# Hey, it's Eoghy!

> Excuse you, what?

Hey, there! Welcome to my profile. I'm Eoghan, nice to meet you! So I know it looks like a nightmare but you pronounce it as *"O-in"*. Or *"O-E"* for Eoghy. Not as terrible as it seems!

I am a Python developer with experience in systems engineering, software engineering, and automation. I was always engineering things from junk as a kid, earning me the title of "Tink" for a while there.

> What does that even mean?

**Eoghy***Unscripted* is actually just a promise I made to myself a few years ago to live my life as unscripted as possible... within reason! I fear my body is a little old for some adventures.

## General Interests

When I am not programming or working, I enjoy spending time outside when the weather is nice. I also enjoy nightly walks, reading, practicing new language skills, spending time with friends, hiking, and cooking.

### "Penny Arcade"

Designed and built for the nostalgia, the "Penny Arcade" is a core Python application that lets users play solo games like Blackjack or Hangman in a terminal or console window.

### I, Eoghy

I started the thought process on this project here, which is simply a class file that represents me. When this project is finished, you will be able to treat the Eoghy object like a person. Seriously, it's going to have some neat stuff.

### Whiteboard Thoughts

* `Tamagotchi Pet:` Okay so, hear me out &ndash; A Tamagotchi pet, but it's just a computer game where you take care of a digital version of yourself.
* `Story Game:` Wouldn't it be cool to build a story game that let's you choose your own endings - like those "Goosebumps" stories we all read as kid?
* `My Binary Diary:` A digital version of Tom Riddle's Diary but you pre-set the phrases to reply with like that one time on "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" when Sabrina made a clone and it could only say three (3) phrases
