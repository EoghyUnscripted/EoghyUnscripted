# Hey, it's Eoghy!

Hey, there! Welcome to my profile. I'm Eoghan, nice to meet you! I am a Python developer with experience in systems engineering, software engineering, and automation. I was always engineering things from junk as a kid, earning me the title of "Tink" for a while there.

While I am academically trained across the technical stack (LAMP), I much prefer working behind the scenes building scalable core functions and features. I love creating code to do all the things and woud love to build my own Python libraries, someday. Or even a new language built off of Python.

> What does that even mean?

**Eoghy***Unscripted* is actually just a promise I made to myself a few years ago to live my life as unscripted as possible... within reason! I fear my body is a little old for some adventures.

## General Interests

When I am not programming or working, I enjoy spending time outside when the weather is nice. I also enjoy nightly walks, reading, practicing new language skills, spending time with friends, hiking, and cooking. I'm also always listening to music.

### "Penny Arcade"

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Repo-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/EoghyUnscripted/Arcade-Games-Core)
[![Replit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Replit%20Demo-DD1200?style=for-the-badge&logo=Replit&logoColor=white)](https://replit.com/@EoghyUnscripted/Penny-Arcade)

Designed and built for the nostalgia, the "Penny Arcade" is a core Python application that lets users play solo games like Blackjack or Hangman in a terminal or console window.

### I, Eoghy

Recently, I've been pondering more about how I can merge my resume and portfolio together to create something fun and interactive.

> So, what's the idea?

I've developed a few projects in my endeavor to create a decent portfolio. And after a few attmepts with different ideas, I think the idea will be to create a scalable app using an `Eoghy.py` class file to store basic information as if I were in an interview. Like what projects I'm working on.

#### A few details that elude me at the moment:

1. Do I create a RESTful web app?
2. If I create a web app, should I learn how to create an Eoghy chat bot?

### Whiteboard Thoughts

* `Tamagotchi Pet:` Okay so, hear me out &ndash; A Tamagotchi pet, but it's just a computer game where you take care of a digital version of yourself.
* `Story Game:` Wouldn't it be cool to build a story game that let's you choose your own endings - like those "Goosebumps" stories we all read as kid?
* `My Binary Diary:` A digital version of Tom Riddle's Diary but you pre-set the phrases to reply with like that one time on "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" when Sabrina made a clone and it could only say three (3) phrases

# Goals

* [ ] Develop a Python library
* [ ] Deploy Project Rocky
